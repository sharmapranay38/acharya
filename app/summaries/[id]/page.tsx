            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Neural networks represent a fundamental paradigm shift in computing, moving away from traditional
              algorithmic approaches toward systems that can learn from data. Inspired by the biological neural networks
              in the human brain, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become the backbone of modern artificial
              intelligence and machine learning applications.
            </p>

            <h3>Structure and Components</h3>
            <p>
              At their core, neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes or "neurons." A typical neural
              network architecture includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Input Layer:</strong> Receives the initial data or features
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Hidden Layers:</strong> Process the information through weighted connections
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Output Layer:</strong> Produces the final prediction or classification
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each neuron applies an activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs, introducing non-linearity
              that allows the network to learn complex patterns.
            </p>

            <h3>Training Process</h3>
            <p>Neural networks learn through a process called training, which involves:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Forward Propagation:</strong> Data passes through the network to generate predictions
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Error Calculation:</strong> The difference between predictions and actual values is measured
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Backpropagation:</strong> The error is propagated backward to adjust connection weights
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Optimization:</strong> Weights are updated using algorithms like gradient descent
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              This iterative process continues until the network achieves satisfactory performance on the training data.
            </p>

            <h3>Types of Neural Networks</h3>
            <p>Various neural network architectures have been developed for specific tasks:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Feedforward Neural Networks:</strong> The simplest form where information flows in one direction
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong> Specialized for image processing and computer
                vision
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):</strong> Designed for sequential data like text and time
                series
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):</strong> A type of RNN that addresses the vanishing gradient
                problem
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):</strong> Used for generating new data similar to
                training data
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Applications</h3>
            <p>Neural networks have revolutionized numerous fields:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Computer vision and image recognition</li>
              <li>Natural language processing and translation</li>
              <li>Speech recognition and synthesis</li>
              <li>Medical diagnosis and drug discovery</li>
              <li>Financial forecasting and fraud detection</li>
              <li>Autonomous vehicles and robotics</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenges and Limitations</h3>
            <p>Despite their power, neural networks face several challenges:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Require large amounts of training data</li>
              <li>Computationally intensive to train</li>
              <li>Prone to overfitting without proper regularization</li>
              <li>Lack interpretability (the "black box" problem)</li>
              <li>Sensitive to hyperparameter choices</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              Neural networks represent one of the most significant advances in computing of the past few decades. As
              research continues and computational resources improve, their capabilities and applications will likely
              expand further, driving innovation across industries and scientific disciplines.
